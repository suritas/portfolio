					<h2>Hi, thanks for visiting my portfolio!</h2>
					<p>A little about me: I recently received my Masters of Science in Information from the University of Michigan, in the Human Computer Interaction & User Experience Program.
					<br>My passion is research, which I have been doing for over 5 years, most recently through UX Consulting. I also have a passion for technical and educational writing, and I am curious how language can be combined with UX methodology to improve discoverability, particularly for mobile products.
					<br>I currently live in Seattle, Washington where I was born and raised. When I am not working, you can find me birdwatching, at Trader Joe's, or enjoying the Pacific Northwest's sights.  
					</p>
					<br>
					<h2>My approach</h2>
					<p>My background in scientific research and technical education taught me to communicate complex processes with precision and care. With UI, I combine affordances and signifiers with concise language to guide the user. In practice, I frequently use information architecture, survey, qualitative & quantitative analysis, task observation, and preference testing to inform my design solutions.
