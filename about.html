					<h2>Hi, there!</h2>
					<p> I am a Qualitative Research, Prototyping, and Project Management professional with 8+ years managing technical & non-technical projects, consulting experience in UX Research & Design, and a Masters in User Experience & Human Computer Interaction.
My passion is bridging the gap between research and design through cutting-edge UX Methods and Lean Project Management. 
I enjoy working with day-to-day and emerging platforms including mobile, smart (voice), and multi-device integration products.
Find me "in the zone" whenever I am putting together a research protocol or conducting qualitative research/analysis, implementing for process/product improvements or designing and presenting interactive prototypes. 
					<br> When I am not working, you can find me birdwatching, playing badminton, or simply enjoying the Pacific Northwest's natural vistas.    				</p>
					<br>
					<h2>My approach</h2>
					<p> My work is guided by UX-R (User Experience Research), Design Thinking, and Process Improvement principles from the University of Michigan's prestigious Masters of Science in Information and the Lean Six Sigma Project Management certification.
					<br> My background in research, technical project management, and database training facilitation allows me to communicate complex processes with precision and care. Both for users and for stakeholders and clients. 
					<br> In practice, I frequently use scientific and lean methods to develop a research protocol, and conduct tailored qualitative & quantitative analyses such as competitive/comparative analysis, affinity mapping, heuristic evaluation, contextual inquiry interviews, information architecture, process & pain point mapping, survey, task observation, and preference & A/B testing to inform my design solutions. I typically prototype using Figma and Adobe XD, creating elements with Adobe Illustrator.
