					<h2>Hi, there!</h2>
					<p> I’m a UX Research, UX Design, and Project Management professional with 8+ years experience. I manage enterprise technical & non-technical projects and UX research and design for start-ups such as Floyd Home and Evva Health, and enterprises like NBC-Universal and CNBC. I’ve worked with platforms including mobile, smart, voice,  and multi-device integrations. Find me “in the zone” developing research protocols, conducting analyses, or prototyping. 
<br> My educational background includes a Masters of Science in Information: User Experience & Human Computer Interaction from the University of Michigan’s premier UX Masters program and a GLSS Lean Six Sigma Black Belt.
<br> Outside work you can find me reading, playing badminton, or enjoying the Pacific Northwest's vistas and restaurants.
  				</p>
					<br>
					<h2>My approach</h2>
					<p> My work is guided by User Experience principles and Lean methodologies. 
<br>I am passionate about guiding teams and problem solving for the user. Driving both UX research and UX design phases in all my projects, I bridge the gap between research and design. 

<br>In practice, I often use (1) scientific and lean methods to develop a cohesive research protocol, (2) project management skills and tools such as Smartsheet, Miro, and Sharepoint to track progress, (3) tailored qualitative & quantitative research and analysis methods such as competitive/comparative analysis, affinity mapping, heuristic evaluation, contextual inquiry interviews, information architecture, process & pain point mapping, survey, task observation, and preference & A/B testing, and more to uncover findings (4) Figma, Adobe XD, and Adobe Illustrator to design and prototype solutions and to visualize data.

<br>My unique background prior to User Experience is in (1) scientific research at the University of Washington, (2) technical & non-technical enterprise project management at the Washington State Department of Health, and (3) database training facilitation at Neighborhood House; this experience has allowed me to communicate complex processes with precision and care for users, clients, and stakeholders and see problems from a variety of perspectives.
